                                    <p>“Where am I?” After a while, Nikhil got his consciousness. He first saw Sanjana’s face as his head was in her lap. Suddenly he felt some liquid drops on his face. Yes, Sanjana was crying…</p>

                                    <p>“What? Why? I mean you told that I <em>ruined</em> our relationship… Why in the seven hells I do such things? I didn’t get anything. And where are others? What is done with the party?”</p>

                                    <p>“Nikhil, please. Don’t pretend to be unknown. Today, I felt shame for what you did. How can one abuse his own father, though he is step-father – in front of the whole crowd? After all, he fostered you. And further, he helped you in buying a clinic and a home in Mumbai. How can you become so rude to him…?”</p>

                                    <p>And then Sanjana told him everything that happened at the party. She saw the expression on Nikhil’s face when she told everything to him. She had seen the guiltiness in his eyes. His eyes were full of feelings of atonement.</p>

                                    <p>Her tears were still flowing from her eyes.</p>
                                    <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

                                    <!-- wp:paragraph -->
                                    <p>“Please Sanjana, believe me. I didn’t remember anything. I think I’d lost the control of my brain at that time. Because I can’t abuse my father, that also on the front of the whole crowd…” Nikhil felt very guilty at that time. But his doctor mind processed the whole thing very fast, and suddenly jumped to the conclusion, “Wait, wait, wait… Oh my God! Sanjana, I think I am suffered from some serious mental disorder. Initially, I felt some dizziness, some of my co-workers complained to me that I was whining on some occasions, I felt some stiffness in my joints sometimes. Initially, I thought that it was due to workload, but after today’s incident I’m sure that I have a problem with my central nervous system, and it is progressing day-by-day…”</p>

                                    <!-- wp:paragraph -->
                                    <p>“What? Really? Then first go to your home and meet…”</p>
                                    <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

                                    <!-- wp:paragraph -->
                                    <p>“No, no, no. I don’t have time. My disease is increasing day-by-day. And furthermore, he will not accept my excuse. He will simply think that I’m lying. And he will thinken that my hand is full of the fishness and stones and that I’m went to kill him with my shark… But don’t be shy, my mind is not going to kill anyone…Yes, I feel like the heaven… You must be the <em>hoor</em> of the hell…”</p>
                                    <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

                                    <!-- wp:paragraph -->
                                    <p>What? He again started his meaningless whining. Sanjana was in shock with this second incident. He had lost the control of his mind again, all he spoke was meaningless and with many grammatical errors. Surely he was suffering from some serious mental disease. But which? Sanjana herself was a doctor. She had seen many emergency cases in her life, some of them were more serious than this. But this was her fiancé, so she just became numb and felt like her mind became blank on that occasion. She didn’t realize what to do. She was of soft-hearted, and very emotional and started crying again. It seemed that her tears affected on Nikhil. He stopped whining and get his consciousness again.</p>
                                    <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

                                    <!-- wp:paragraph -->
                                    <p>“What? My whining again. I told you. I’m suffering from some serious disease. I don’t have any time. Let’s go to AIIMS as soon as possible. I want to live, Sanjana, for you, for our dreams, for everything. I don’t want to die. I even don’t want to live mad, I want to live healthily. You are a doctor, please cure me.” His voice was wet with emotions. He wanted that Sanjana would cure him. But she was just beside him in helplessness. His words <em>I want to live </em>were kept on ringing in her ears. This increased her pain. She wanted to do something, but simply she was unable to do anything as neither it was her hospital nor the patient was some common one. That day she realized that it is a very different thing to cure some random patient and cure her boyfriend.</p>
                                    <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

                                    <!-- wp:paragraph -->
                                    <p>Nikhil then realized that Sanjana was of very soft hearted. He thought that only he had to do whatever should be done. “Ok. Take me to Delhi, in our college. Someone there will surely help you.”</p>
                                    <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

                                    <!-- wp:paragraph -->
                                    <p>“But I don’t have enough money for your cure…”</p>
                                    <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

                                    <!-- wp:paragraph -->
                                    <p>“Please Sanjana, I told you. I don’t have time. I’ve many friends there. Someone will surely help you. Before I start whining again, listen carefully, let’s go to AIIMS, Delhi for my cure. Don’t worry about money, someone will go to the Himalayas for Sanjeevani. Jai Balram. Har har Ramayana…”</p>
                                    <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

                                    <!-- wp:paragraph -->
                                    <p>He started whining again. She then realized that it was the serious case indeed and so decided to go for Delhi on that night only.</p>
                                    <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

                                    <!-- wp:paragraph -->
                                    <p>It was a dark night. The whole coach was sleeping under the blanket of darkness. The only sound in the air was of engine and wheels. It was some very rural area in which the train was travelling. So, outside of the train was also completely dark. Sanjana thought that her life is also as dark as the surroundings. It was about midnight. But due to tension, she was unable to sleep. Her mind was full of a storm of various thoughts at that time. Until just some hours ago, she thought, she was the happiest person on the earth. Newly received the degree of MBBS, having a good guy back to her with whom she was going to engage, awaiting job in Mumbai… life was going very smoothly. And suddenly from none of where some black cloud came and all became dark in her life. When she looked out from the window, she observed the same darkness out there. This darkness now started to frightened her. So, she closed the window. That stopped the stormy wind to stroke on her face. At that time, she thought that if there could be the same window on the mind that could stop the storm of thoughts which were running through her mind.</p>
                                    <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

                                    <!-- wp:paragraph -->
                                    <p>In the same darkness, she observed that some black shape was in just in front of her. It was of Nikhil. He was slipping by clenched his legs tightly to the chest and his hands covering the legs. Sanjana observed him. She amazed that he was really sleeping or just pretend to be sleep. But whatever he was doing, Sanjana felt some relief at that moment, as he was calm. She had seen many kinds of mental disorders, but at that moment she was very confused about which one Nikhil suffered with. She closed eyes to gain some relief. All of those of pain of seeing, she thought, so better to close eyes and saw nothing.</p>
                                    <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

                                    <!-- wp:paragraph -->
                                    <p><em>Pal pal dil ke paas, tum rehti ho…</em> as soon as she closed her eyes, she started remembering her joyful past. Events from the past were pictured in front of her as she was observing them as live. She remembered that day when Nikhil played this very beautiful song for her. She smiled after remembering it. Then she saw that day when they both were on Marine drive and was seeing the sunset. Suddenly, the sun had set, and once again the darkness had covered her. And in this same darkness, she heard a very familiar voice… <em>I want to live, Sanjana, for you. I don’t want to die… please save me…</em> And her eyes opened suddenly. That voice was of Nikhil’s. She felt like suffocating.</p>
                                    <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

                                    <!-- wp:paragraph -->
                                    <p>“What?” She saw that Nikhil was awoken when she opened her eyes.</p>
                                    <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

                                    <!-- wp:paragraph -->
                                    <p>“Feeling – suffocation – where – we?” She amazed! Both of them felt the same emotions, but for different reasons. But the more serious thing she noted was that he was unable to utter the whole sentence, instead, he spoke word-by-word. Also, she noticed weakness in his voice.</p>
                                    <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

                                    <!-- wp:paragraph -->
                                    <p>“I don’t know where we are. But it had been about five to six hours since we boarded.” She replied.</p>
                                    <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

                                    <!-- wp:paragraph -->
                                    <p>“Suffocating – open – window”</p>
                                    <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

                                    <!-- wp:paragraph -->
                                    <p>She opened the window immediately. And further told him that they will go outside when next stoppage arrived. Her tension increased as she heard Nikhil’s voice. Weakness echoed in his voice. It also seemed that he wanted to say more, but was unable to speak. She felt very guilty as she was unable to cure him. Then a sudden jerk caused the halt in the thoughts of her. It followed by the strong whistle of the engine. It seemed that it was the next stoppage of the train. Sanjana thought that it would better if she took Nikhil in the fresh air outside for some time.</p>
                                    <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

                                    <!-- wp:paragraph -->
                                    <p>Although inside the coach was full of darkness, outside of it was quite bright due that only one light of the station. As time was of midnight, and the area was remote, no one was there on the station. As the station was small, the stoppage time of the train was very short. When Sanjana came outside the coach with Nikhil then she realized that she was the only one to left the coach. Then she looked at his back to ensure that Nikhil was followed her.</p>
                                    <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

                                    <!-- wp:paragraph -->
                                    <p>She shocked!</p>
                                    <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

                                    <!-- wp:paragraph -->
                                    <p>Was he <em>that</em> Nikhil with whom she started her journey? After boarding the train, it was the first time she looked at him as Nikhil preferred to sleep when they boarded. His face was pale like a withered flower, but harsh and maybe stiff, with a slight yellow tone. It was just like some expressionless face, eyes looking, rather staring in some infinite direction, meaninglessly. He was walking slowly. When she looked at her knees, she came to know about the reason for her walking. Both of his tibias bent laterally from their respective femur. She thought that with that body posture, he must found difficulty in walking, ataxia, she thought. She felt very guilty at that time because she only told him to went out of the coach. She felt that due to her only he was suffering that pain.</p>
                                    <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

                                    <!-- wp:paragraph -->
                                    <p>Her mind started to work fast. Ataxia (difficulty walking), speech impairment, emotional and behavioural changes, enlargement of abdomen, weakness… symptoms of some familiar disease. She moved closer towards him, look deeply into his eyes.</p>
                                    <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

                                    <!-- wp:paragraph -->
                                    <p>Kayser-Fleischer ring.</p>
                                    <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

                                    <!-- wp:paragraph -->
                                    <p>Yes, there was a rusty brown coloured ring around his iris. The Wilson Disease, she remembered. It is an inherited disorder in which there is too much copper in the body’s tissues. And in Nikhil’s case, it seemed that excess of copper starts damaging the liver and nervous system. It caused the affected organs to stop working correctly.</p>
                                    <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

                                    <!-- wp:paragraph -->
                                    <p>“It’s Wilson Disease, Nikhil. Excess of copper in your tissues, it is curable. As soon as we reach Delhi, start taking medicines, and you will be as healthy as you were…” First time after that party, there was a smile on Sanjana’s face. The thought that <em>Nikhil will be healthy again </em>and<em> will solve all issues</em> made her very happy. But, then she realized the cost of medicine, too costly, she thought. But can be managed, have to manage, for Nikhil.</p>
                                    <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

                                    <!-- wp:paragraph -->
                                    <p>“You will be okay very soon. You will <em>live</em>. You are not going to die…” Suddenly whistle blown again, a sign of departure of the train, “Let’s get back in. Until the morning we will be in Delhi…”</p>
                                    <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

                                    <!-- wp:paragraph -->
                                    <p>“Nikhil, where are you going? The door is right here. Don’t run, we’ll miss train…” When she was about to enter the door of the coach, she saw that Nikhil was running in the wrong direction. Why the hell he <em>ran</em> in the wrong direction? What just happened to him? She thought. The train already started moving. But it seemed that he was not in the mood to aboard. She has to go with him, she thought and ran after him as fast as possible. But he was running incredibly fast, she observed, as like he wanted to take the path in some competition. But why? “Nikhil, STOP!” She screamed. Now it was about the end of the platform, and he was not in the mood to stop.</p>

                                    <p>“Can’t – control – legs – uncontrollable – movement…” She then heard slow, but with a speedily decreasing pitch of the voice. Damn! Uncontrollable and Unpredictable movements. Another symptom of Wilson Disease.</p>
                                    <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

                                    <!-- wp:paragraph -->
                                    <p>Suddenly she saw a bright yellow light approaching… Bang!!!</p>
                                    <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

                                    <!-- wp:paragraph -->
                                    <p>When she reached that point, she saw that Nikhil was in the pool of his own blood. A big truck was right there. Its tyres just ran over his legs. And after saw this, driver of it ran off. Sanjana fell to the earth after saw that, all of the hopes that she developed in past some moments were seemed to be destroyed. That pleasure of detecting disease remained until a few moments. She felt really helpless when she remembered that all her things including her phone, money etc. all left behind on the train.</p>

                                    <p>But, there was no time for these thoughts. First of all, what she would need to do is to tie a bandage to his wounds. She must have to do because if more blood flew then it would be a lesser chance to save him. So, she started to do that.</p>
                                    <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

                                    <!-- wp:paragraph -->
                                    <p>“What? Am I really touching a <em>living body</em>?” When she touched her feet to tie a wound, she felt like wood, not living tissue. Then she touched other parts of his body. That time she realized that nearly all of the tissues on his body became stiff, and the result of that was the rigid limbs of him.</p>
                                    <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

                                    <!-- wp:paragraph -->
                                    <p>She looked into his eyes. He was still staring at infinite meaninglessly like nothing happened. But in those meaningless eyes also, she saw that they wanted to see more, not just want to die. She realized that the nervous system is seriously damaged. She couldn’t resist her tears anymore…</p>
                                    <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

                                    <!-- wp:paragraph -->
                                    <p>“Leave – me – gonna – die – please…” She heard Nikhil’s words.</p>
                                    <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

                                    <!-- wp:paragraph -->
                                    <p>“No one going to die. I will save…” But before she could say anything, Nikhil vomited. It was of blood. As Sanjana saw that in deem light of the moon, she cried more. More and more amount of blood was flowing out of his body, which shouldn’t be. She felt guiltier, as she was unable to do anything, except prayer.</p>

                                    <p>Fast forward to a few years.</p>
                                    <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

                                    <p>Sanjana and Nikhil both were in a big hospital and research centre named <em>Nikhanjana. </em>It was really a big hospital. It was a time of end their duty. They both left the hospital, and after a moment they were driving a car on wide roads of Mumbai. As usual, after reaching home, they sat in the balcony. At front of them was wide Arabian sea, on the coast of Marine Drive. In front of them, stormy waves of the sea were washing the stones of protection wall. It was rather a glorious view was sunset. Sun had been set and darkness in the air increasing slowly.</p>

                                    <p>“See, I told you many years ago that one day I will own a flat in this beautiful place. And here we are! This our <em>chhota sa ghar </em>in <em>prem ki gali.</em> Truly, I want to sing that song in present tense instead of future tense, <em>zilmil sitaron ka aangan hai, rimzim barasata saavan hai. Aisa sundar sapna apna jeevan hai…</em> (Meaning: Here are the shining stars over a courtyard, here is a season of rain. Our life is like the season of rain…)” Nikhil still remembered that day and reminded that to Sanjana.</p>

                                    <p>“Yes, here we are! But can you please switch on the lights, I fear this darkness…” Sanjana felt like darkness was still covered her. She felt like the atmosphere was going more and darker…</p>

                                    <p>“Madam, what happened to you? Can I help you…?” She felt that someone was shaking her. Some music was flowing in the air. She then opened her eyes. The world was very different than what she saw sometimes back. She saw some person in front of her, who was asking for her. And that music was from the radio of that person’s car. It was time of early morning she realized. She didn’t get the scenario around her. She took some time to understand things.</p>

                                    <p>She looked around her. <em>Where is Nikhil?</em> She saw a truck some distance to her. She quickly went behind the truck.</p>
