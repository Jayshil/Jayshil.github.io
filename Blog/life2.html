                                    <p>The origin of life is not the only coincidence happened on the earth. Life could originate somewhere else also. There are theories that early life forms could be originated in the core of the comet also.</p>
                                    <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

                                    <!-- wp:paragraph -->
                                    <p>But the <em><strong>intelligent life</strong></em>, which is originated by desired evolution is important. There are many obstacles in the way to evolve intelligent life. Our own earth had suffered several mass extinctions in the past. In almost every one of them, the majority of life was destroyed and nature had to start with the square one. Though in none of those events 100 per cent of life had destroyed, but that doesn't guarantee that in future it is not going to happen.</p>
                                    <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

                                    <!-- wp:paragraph -->
                                    <p>There are several factors that can affect life. Every star is rotating around the centre of its parent galaxy. Every galaxy is full of dust regions, giant clouds, very active star formation regions etc. So in the way of orbiting the galactic centre star can encounter such regions. In such a case, cloud or dust may spread in the planetary system. That would resist the star-light to reach the planet. Consequently, it will cause a reduction in the temperature of the planet, because less energy will reach the planet. The planet would be ice cold during this time duration. Kilometres of a thick crust of ice will be covered on the surface of the planet. Survival of life will be very difficult in these situations.</p>
                                    <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

                                    <!-- wp:paragraph -->
                                    <p>On the other hand, during its rotation around the galactic centre, the parent star can attract meteorites towards it. This may cause heavy meteorite shower on the planet. This heavy bombardment can destroy life. Also, if the star enters the region in which the density of star is very high, then high energetic radiation, supernova explosion of any star can damage life on the planet.</p>

                                    <p>We are <em>lucky</em> because at present our sun is in Orion arm of the milky way which is comparatively less dense.</p>
                                    <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

                                    <!-- wp:paragraph -->
                                    <p>In our galaxy, almost all stars have their companions because stars are in general form in groups. So to find the individual star is difficult. But, our sun is a unique coincidence. This coincidence is important because gravitational tug between two stars can result in no formation of planets itself. As far as we know till now, there is no companion of the sun though there are theories that suggest that our sun&nbsp;<em>has</em> a companion but probably a dwarf star very far away, which might be responsible for a periodic mass extinction on the earth, named&nbsp;<em>nemesis.</em></p>
                                    <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

                                    <!-- wp:paragraph -->
                                    <p>Still, it is hard to survive for life. Any violent phenomena happen in the nearby universe and it's done! And there are so many violent phenomena in the universe, supernovae explosion, gamma-ray bursts, comet shower, anything. Literally, life is very fragile, anything can destroy it before it became intelligent enough to <em>survive by itself</em>.</p>
                                    <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

                                    <!-- wp:paragraph -->
                                    <p>Darwin postulated the principle -&nbsp;<em><strong>'Survival of fittest'</strong></em>, but I think to survive&nbsp;<em><strong>luck</strong></em> is another important factor. Consider the case of dinosaurs. They have ruled on our earth 65 million years ago for more than 150 million years. So they were fit enough to survive. Some serious accident took their lives, maybe the impact of a big asteroid or some volcanic activity beneath the surface of the earth. And then only the ruler of the mother earth changed. Warm-blooded mammals came into the picture of the ancient earth.</p>
                                    <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

                                    <!-- wp:paragraph -->
                                    <p>Mammals were comparatively less fit to the dinosaurs to survive. They are warm-blooded animals, so they need extra calories to maintain their body temperature. They foster their babies in their womb for some time period. In this period their efficiency reduces. If some predator starts hunting them in their pregnancy period, both mother and baby will suffer to death. And born of a baby after the pregnancy period is also difficult, the probability of surviving mother and baby is less compared to the born by eggs.</p>
                                    <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

                                    <!-- wp:paragraph -->
                                    <p>But still, there are more mammals on the earth than reptiles. Why?&nbsp;<em><strong>Luck.</strong></em> Just imagine that before 65 million years ago volcanic activity didn't take place and asteroid didn't impact on the earth. Then, mammals would not be here to rule on the earth. Primitive monkeys would still be jumping from one branch to another branch on the top of the tree.</p>
                                    <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

                                    <!-- wp:paragraph -->
                                    <p>Even then, to form intelligent life is difficult. For technological advancements silicon, nickel, cobalt etc heavy elements are mandatory. All these are heavy elements, they must have settled down when the differentiation of the earth happened. And if by&nbsp;<em>luck</em> these elements couldn't come to the surface of the earth by some processes like volcanic activity or so, today's technological advancement would not be possible. Again,&nbsp;<em><strong>luck</strong></em>!</p>
