                                    <p>Before writing anything I would like to mention a very famous quotation by Carl Sagan:</p>
                                    <blockquote>
                                        Look again at that dot. That's here. That's home. That's us. On it everyone you love, everyone you know, everyone you ever heard of, every human being who ever was, lived out their lives. The aggregate of our joy and suffering, thousands of confident religions, ideologies, and economic doctrines, every hunter and forager, every hero and coward, every creator and destroyer of civilization, every king and peasant, every young couple in love, every mother and father, hopeful child, inventor and explorer, every teacher of morals, every corrupt politician, every "superstar," every "supreme leader," every saint and sinner in the history of our species lived there--on a mote of dust suspended in a sunbeam. <br> <br>
                                        The Earth is a very small stage in a vast cosmic arena. Think of the rivers of blood spilled by all those generals and emperors so that, in glory and triumph, they could become the momentary masters of a fraction of a dot. Think of the endless cruelties visited by the inhabitants of one corner of this pixel on the scarcely distinguishable inhabitants of some other corner, how frequent their misunderstandings, how eager they are to kill one another, how fervent their hatreds. <br><br>
                                        Our posturings, our imagined self-importance, the delusion that we have some privileged position in the Universe, are challenged by this point of pale light. Our planet is a lonely speck in the great enveloping cosmic dark. In our obscurity, in all this vastness, there is no hint that help will come from elsewhere to save us from ourselves. <br><br>
                                        The Earth is the only world known so far to harbor life. There is nowhere else, at least in the near future, to which our species could migrate. Visit, yes. Settle, not yet. Like it or not, for the moment the Earth is where we make our stand. <br><br>
                                        It has been said that astronomy is a humbling and character-building experience. There is perhaps no better demonstration of the folly of human conceits than this distant image of our tiny world. To me, it underscores our responsibility to deal more kindly with one another, and to preserve and cherish the pale blue dot, the only home we've ever known. <br><br>
                                        -- Carl Sagan,Â Pale Blue Dot, 1994
                                    </blockquote>

                                    <p>The above image was taken from the Voyager 1, on February 14, 1990, on the request of Carl Sagan. At that time the spacecraft was 6.4 billion kilometres away from the earth. Some days ago I read the above quotation from the famous book by Carl Sagan '<em>The Pale Blue Dot</em>'. That pale blue dot means nothing but our own planet,&nbsp;<em><strong>Mother Earth.</strong></em> In the whole universe, our earth is very lonely in its kind, very unique in a sense. The universe is very large. Compare to it our earth is very small, though it is&nbsp;<em><strong>special.</strong></em> Because it has&nbsp;<em><strong>life.</strong></em></p>
                                    <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

                                    <!-- wp:paragraph -->
                                    <p>Even though the earth might be very special, what is its significance compared to the whole universe? Just a gamma-ray burst happen or maybe some comet shower happen and we all have done! All those illusions on the earth would vanish by just one violent event in the nearby universe.</p>
                                    <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

                                    <!-- wp:paragraph -->
                                    <p><strong>Then what is the significance of all our&nbsp;<em>karmas</em> which we are doing every day?</strong></p>
                                    <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

                                    <!-- wp:paragraph -->
                                    <p><strong>Nothing</strong>, right?</p>
                                    <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

                                    <!-- wp:paragraph -->
                                    <p>Whatever written in the above quotation is very true. Our karmas, which we are doing every day are for what? This much struggle is for what?! Just for a pale blue dot! Wait for the next one or two centuries and we are going to be extinct! Why? Greenhouse effect, pollution, etc. According to Royal Astronomer Martin Rees, the twenty-first century would be the last century for the human being, provided that we don't extinct ourselves by some misdeed, say nuclear war, earlier.</p>
                                    <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

                                    <!-- wp:paragraph -->
                                    <p>Now compare the age of the earth and the average lifetime of the humans. Approximately 4.5 billion years to just 100 years. It's a very huge difference. Then these much of infatuations and vanity for what, for whom? We born just a few years ago and will be erased from this stage of a cosmic drama in some years. Then also an average human always tries to achieve something more and more, spend his/her roughly whole life in doing so. But what's the point of it? Even only after some time of his/her death, his/her works - deeds will be going to be forgotten. This bitter truth is known by roughly everyone, then also the race of obtaining more and more is never-ending.</p>
                                    <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

                                    <!-- wp:paragraph -->
                                    <p>This all thing has to do with that&nbsp;<strong>brain&nbsp;</strong>in the human skull&nbsp;of 1400 cc of volume and roughly 1 kg of weight. Humans were gifted by such a distinguished brain in the ladder of the evolution. It is the best tool for humans. They can do anything they want, obtain anything they want, just by using that small piece of the human body,&nbsp;<strong>the brain.</strong> But why only humans gifted by such an extraordinary gift? Was it just a happy coincidence, or a preplanned and logical event? Maybe just a&nbsp;<em>happy coincidence!</em>&nbsp;If there was no such drought that caused a shortage of food in jungles, specifically on the trees, of East Africa, then the primates would have remained on the trees till now maybe. Even after leaving trees as their permanent habitation if they had a strong body (legs), they probably had never used their brain to survive. Perhaps primate of that age was the most unfit animal survive. Though only by use of their brain, one of the evolved members of primates is on the top of the evolutionary tree today. Which nature had made him such extraordinary, he is trying to be against the same nature to control nature.</p>

                                    <!-- wp:paragraph -->
                                    <p>But this is only the tale of humans. Don't the creation of life on the earth is a big coincidence? I described all those coincidences in the first part of this series: <a href="#" target="_blank">Life: The Lucky Coincidence</a>. Not only one coincidence, but a series of coincidences. If only one of them did not happen, then you were not here to read this article. Then the question arises:&nbsp;<em><strong>What is the aim of life?</strong></em><em>&nbsp;</em>And even if life was not originated on the earth, then also there would be no effect on the solar system or nearby universe. Also, today there is life on the earth, even then there is no difference in the local universe.</p>
                                    <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

                                    <!-- wp:paragraph -->
                                    <p>Then we can argue that, if there is no aim of life, then&nbsp;<strong>what could be the aim of all other material things?</strong> The solar system, the milky way, black holes, neutron stars, quasars, all these things - what could be the possible motto behind all these stuff? The spacetime could be in existence even without them. Then what is the need of producing all of them?</p>

                                    <p><em><strong>Why there is something, rather than nothing?</strong></em></p>
                                    <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

                                    <!-- wp:paragraph -->
                                    <p>Logically the universe with nothing in it is more stable than the universe with a matter in it. Matter disturb the balance. It is better to have nothing in it. Occam's razor also (maybe) pointing towards it. (?)</p>
                                    <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

                                    <p><em>Nevertheless, everything is there</em>. Stars, Planets, Galaxies, Galaxy Clusters, Galaxy Superclusters, everything had been originated. The milky way created. In it, some common star, named sun, originated. A planet around that star had been created at a proper distance around it. On that planet, all proper conditions had been established, and life created! 65 million years ago, a meteorite fell on the earth, which destroyed the&nbsp;<em>unintelligent</em> dinosaurs and opened the way for evolution for intelligent beings. Remember that in the presence of dinosaurs, intelligent life would not have evolved.</p>

                                    <p>Statistically, the probability of happening all these things is very low. It should not happen. But it did! Doesn't that mean that&nbsp;<em><strong>the aim of the universe is to produce an intelligent life? And doesn't the aim of the intelligent life is to use the universe to make its own origination meaningful, by observing it (the universe), by sustaining themselves (the life), by spreading themselves, by making universe full with life?!</strong></em></p>
