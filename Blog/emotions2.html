                                    <p>In my last <a href="#">article</a> about emotions, I described some of my views about emotions. But still many doubts are there. The problem is that philosophy and logic suggest something else to happen, but in reality, it didn't happen.</p>
                                    <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

                                    <!-- wp:paragraph -->
                                    <p>My quest to find the truth about emotions, especially&nbsp;<em>love</em>, started when my desperate friend failed to get a girlfriend! He was very angry then like everybody had a girlfriend but him. And then his inability to find a girlfriend transformed into angry to the whole concept of love. Then I did a great amount of thinking to find the reality behind the conception of love. Here is the essence of my discussion.</p>
                                    <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

                                    <!-- wp:paragraph -->
                                    <p>According to Plato, there are three types of soul present in any human being: Rational Soul, Emotional Soul and Physical Need Soul. Previously I believed in only two types of them, the first two. Then I read Plato and now I'm convinced that the physical need of any person, like sex, appetite etc., should be count as the third part of his soul.</p>
                                    <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

                                    <!-- wp:paragraph -->
                                    <p>Among these three souls, the last one is very easy to understand. Because the&nbsp;<em>survival&nbsp;</em>of any human being is dependent upon it. One can go to any limit to in order to satisfy the physical need. This is, I think, coded in the gene of humans. This is in fact coded in every creature on the earth.</p>
                                    <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

                                    <!-- wp:paragraph -->
                                    <p>The other aspect of a human is its&nbsp;<em>Rational Soul</em>. This soul is also relatively easy to understand. It purely depends on the logic. You could just follow the logic and from their only, you will get to the intention of doing anything by that human. There may be a difference in logic. Some people just use short time logic while other people can see through time, and apply their logic to a long scale.</p>
                                    <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

                                    <!-- wp:paragraph -->
                                    <p>The remaining soul,&nbsp;<em><strong>the emotional one,</strong></em> is very difficult to understand. It clearly is independent of the logic, or even&nbsp;<em>common sense</em>. In fact, sometimes, the behaviour of emotional soul contradicts to the logic and common sense. That is why it is hard to understand. Here in this discussion, I will mainly focus on one type of emotion,&nbsp;<em><strong>love</strong></em>, especially love between a male and a female.</p>
                                    <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

                                    <!-- wp:paragraph -->
                                    <p>What is love? Well, that is a very tricky question. My personal philosophy fails every time I get to that question. I had many answers, but none of them was satisfactory. One of my friends defines, tries to define, love as a series of events: <strong>Crush, Attraction, Like</strong> and <em><strong>Love</strong></em>. When a male, or female, sees the person from another gender, first s/he feels the intense wave of attraction, <em>crush</em> it is. Then eventually s/he will be infatuated with him/her. This is the phase when one feels a strong attraction towards the another. He named this phase as 'attraction'. After this phase passed the more advanced phase will come, 'like'. Now, after the phase of the attraction, one started to know each other better. But till now they are still in the aroma of the attraction. So, most of the times they would tend to see only positive and good things (things they like, rather, things they&nbsp;<em>want</em> to see) in their partner. Maybe that is why this phase is called '<em>like</em>'.</p>
                                    <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

                                    <!-- wp:paragraph -->
                                    <p>As times goes on, and as an aroma of an attraction and phase of like passes, they start to know each other even better. Now they'll see the things they didn't see in previous phases. This might include negative or not good things about another one. One could find some things in another that one dislikes. The essence of it is that they will start to see, understand their companion more properly. This whole picture might be different from what they thought in the beginning. Even though, after knowing the pros and cons of the other person, one still decided to stay with him/her for a lifetime then, according to that friend of mine, they are said to be in&nbsp;<em><strong>love</strong></em><em>&nbsp;</em>of each other.</p>
                                    <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

                                    <!-- wp:paragraph -->
                                    <p>This is the most&nbsp;<em>satisfactory</em> definition I ever found. But I don't think it is the complete one. It doesn't explain many of things. For example, when two people are in love, then why after a long time they decide to be separated?</p>
                                    <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

                                    <!-- wp:paragraph -->
                                    <p>After defining the <em>love,</em>&nbsp;another question that arises is that what is the&nbsp;<strong><em>need</em></strong> of love in the first place? The Physical needs? Might be, might be not. Apparently, it is the main reason! (?) Evolution will give the proof for this. Every living thing has an intrinsic desire for reproduction and passing his genes to the next generation. In fact, the reproduction is the main thing which can be defined as the characteristics of life. For reproduction, physical needs to be there, to be satisfied.</p>
                                    <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

                                    <!-- wp:paragraph -->
                                    <p>Not all the times! Physical needs can be satisfied by other means also, no need for loving someone. One can always visit a brothel or do masturbate. So, we can't count the physical needs for the reason of being fallen in love.</p>
                                    <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

                                    <!-- wp:paragraph -->
                                    <p>Then what could count?</p>
                                    <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

                                    <!-- wp:paragraph -->
                                    <p>Maybe balancing traits!? I don't have some qualities, you have those. You don't have some qualities, those I have. Why don't we get together to make completeness? I interviewed some of the persons, who are in love with someone as they said. I asked them a single question: Why you need love?</p>
                                    <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

                                    <!-- wp:paragraph -->
                                    <p>One of the answers was like this: I am not the complete person. I need someone who can understand me, who can complete me. In return, I will do the same for her. Another person answered that every person&nbsp;<em>needs</em> another person to share everything s/he achieves, whether it could be <em>joy, happiness</em> or&nbsp;<em>sorrow</em>, anything.</p>
                                    <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

                                    <!-- wp:paragraph -->
                                    <p>Isn't this just the selfishness? In that sense, the satisfaction of the physical need is also a kind of selfishness.</p>
                                    <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

                                    <!-- wp:paragraph -->
                                    <p><em>Is love just some kind of selfishness?</em></p>
                                    <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

                                    <!-- wp:paragraph -->
                                    <p>Maybe, maybe not.</p>
                                    <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

                                    <!-- wp:paragraph -->
                                    <p>There could be some <em>other</em>, some&nbsp;<em>deeper, more profound,&nbsp;<strong>significance</strong></em> of love, otherwise, it would be lost in the long run of evolution.</p>
