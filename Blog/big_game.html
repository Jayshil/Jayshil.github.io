                                    <p>Usually, in this world, many people don’t believe in destiny. Sometimes ago, I was also part of them. I believed that I myself is only responsible for my future. But, then I thought this can’t be the whole story.</p>
                                    <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

                                    <!-- wp:paragraph -->
                                    <p>I watched a famous TV series some times ago. In that series, it was like that all characters behave in such a way that it will go to make some definite future. All events were happening in such a way that in future it will go to benefit someone. This forced me to re-think my ideas about destiny. I thought that whether the same thing could happen to our real world.</p>
                                    <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

                                    <!-- wp:paragraph -->
                                    <p>I thought that it might be possible that in our real world also. We all are living in such a way that it will lead us to some definite future. In that TV series, I was able to observe the behaviour of almost every character. So, in that case, I was able to see the world as a whole, a&nbsp;<strong>big picture</strong>. And so it saw me as some big game.</p>
                                    <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

                                    <!-- wp:paragraph -->
                                    <p>But, in the real world, no one can observe the behaviour of each and every character of it, means all living beings. So the real world doesn’t seem anyone like the big game. But it may be.&nbsp;<em><strong>It may be possible that our destiny is fixed, and we all are acted in such a way to achieve that destiny.</strong></em>&nbsp;If, somehow, we could observe the behaviour of each character of this “big game”, then we could predict it's future, destiny.</p>
                                    <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

                                    <!-- wp:paragraph -->
                                    <p>Physics have something similar to this. According to the laws of physics,&nbsp;<em><strong>if we know the current state of the system of particles, then we can predict its future state</strong></em><strong>.</strong>&nbsp;Classically this is possible. Classically it is possible that we can measure the state of each particle of the system, and so the present state of the system. And so, classically, we can predict the future of that system.&nbsp;<em>Quantum mechanically this is not possible.</em>&nbsp;Because Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle forbids us. But, that is a completely different story.</p>
                                    <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

                                    <!-- wp:paragraph -->
                                    <p>So, we can treat the world as consists of a vast number of living organisms — a system of the world with living organisms as particles. If we somehow identify the present state of all particles — i.e., present state of all living organisms — of the system of the real world, then we can predict its future state, its destiny. But this is impossible for us, because the total number of particles in this system of the real world is very very large, billions of billions. We cannot identify the present state of such a large number of particles. So, we cannot predict the future state.</p>
                                    <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

                                    <!-- wp:paragraph -->
                                    <p>There is another aspect of this story. The future state of the system depends on the present state of the system. But what creates the present state of the system? Of course, the past state. And past state depends on what? The more past state prior to it. This will go on until the time zero. So, we can say that all other states at a time greater than zero are depended on the state of the system at time zero. And in the language of physics, the state of the system at time zero is called the&nbsp;<strong>initial conditions</strong>&nbsp;of the system. If we know the initial conditions of the system, then we can know its state at any time.</p>
                                    <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

                                    <!-- wp:paragraph -->
                                    <p>But, the very important philosophical question is that&nbsp;<strong>what determines the initial conditions of the world?</strong>&nbsp;Is it completely random or some supernatural thing determines it? This is a very important question, because, after all, these initial conditions determine our present and future.</p>
                                    <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

                                    <!-- wp:paragraph -->
                                    <p>So, I can safely conclude that the initial conditions determine the rules of the big game. And it may be possible that some supernatural being determines those rules and now we are forced to play the game according to it.</p>
                                    <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

                                    <!-- wp:paragraph -->
                                    <p>So aren’t we able to take just an independent move on our own because rule forbids it? Are we really just the puppets on the stage of the real world whose string is in the hands of some supernatural being?</p>
