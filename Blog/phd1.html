									<p>
										The principal objective of my first formal research project, 
										which was also the project of my Master's thesis which I did under the guidance of <a target="_blank" href="http://nestor-espinoza.com/">Dr Néstor Espinoza</a> 
										at the Max-Planck Institute for Astronomy in Heidelberg, Germany 
										(now at the Space Telescope Science Institute - STScI, USA), was to study the limb darkening effect using the
										exoplanet transit light curves entitled "Study of the limb darkening effect using exoplanet transit 
										light curves using TESS data".

									<p><span class="image left"><img src="../../images/limb_darkening_sun.jpg" width="300" height="auto" alt="" />Figure 1: Solar limb darkening effect <br> (Credits: Encyclopædia Britannica)</span>While looking 
										at the solar disk it can be easily seen that the solar brightness is not constant over the disk. 
										Instead, as we move towards the limb gets darker; this effect termed as the limb darkening effect of the sun (see Figure 1). 
										Although for stars other than the sun, the limb darkening effect cannot be observed directly, it is there, 
										because the reason behind the limb darkening effect lies in the decreasing temperature of the stellar atmosphere with height, 
										which is not the specific for sun but a general phenomenon. 
										The effect arises because when we look at the stellar limb we are looking at the higher parts of the atmosphere, 
										which are cooler and so radiates fewer amounts of energy and thus appears darker than the centre. 
										This effect can affect the exoplanet transit light curve. 
										If there were no limb darkening effect, the transit light curve would have a flat bottom, 
										as the exoplanet would block the same amount of light while moving in front of the stellar disk. 
										But, due to the limb darkening effect, the exoplanet would hinder the different amount of light and 
										that will result into 'U' shaped bottom of exoplanet transit light curve (see Figure 2). 
										We used exoplanet transit light curve data from recently launched satellite TESS in this work.</p>

									<p>The Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite or TESS, as its name suggests, is a NASA mission led by the 
										Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) to survey roughly whole sky with the primary goal of detecting new transiting exoplanets. 
										Its main target stars are bright nearby (within about 200 pc) stars with spectral types ranging from F5 to M5. 
										The most notable feature of these target stars is their vicinity from the earth. 
										This proximity ensures that each TESS target could have (<i>or</i> some of them already have) follow-up observations 
										from ground-based facilities. We needed these follow-up observations of host stars of our intended target exoplanets to get 
										the refined measurements of stellar properties and to make sure that the intended target is not a false positive but a real exoplanet. 
										That is why we chose previously known exoplanets which already have follow-up observations. 
										This makes our sample size as large as to include 170+ exoplanetary systems that consists of all known transiting exoplanets 
										observed by TESS during its observation sectors 1 to 32.</p>
									
									<p>We used this transit light-curve data from TESS of already known 170+ exoplanetary systems, 
										which have follow-up observations, and modelled it using appropriate software. 
										This modelling yield various planetary as well as stellar parameters including the limb darkening coefficients (LDCs). 
										We used these results to test how well the limb darkening effect is modelled by stellar model atmospheres like ATLAS and PHOENIX. 
										To do that we compared the retrieved LDCs with both ATLAS and PHOENIX model predictions calculated by two authors <a target="_blank" href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017A%26A...600A..30C/abstract">Claret (2017)</a> 
										and <a target="_blank" href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2015MNRAS.450.1879E/abstract">Espinoza & Jordán (2015)</a>. We found that there are offsets between the LDCs computed using methods provided by both of 
										these authors, in both model atmospheres. When calculating LDCs from the method provided by <a target="_blank" href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2015MNRAS.450.1879E/abstract">Espinoza & Jordán (2015)</a>, 
										the offset is roughly the same in both model atmospheres. However, while using the tabulated values of LDCs from <a target="_blank" href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017A%26A...600A..30C/abstract">Claret (2017)</a> 
										the offset is less in the LDCs evaluated using the ATLAS model than those determined using the PHOENIX.</p>
									
									<div class="col-12"><span class="image fit"><img src="../../images/multiplot.png" width="900" height="auto" alt="" />Figure 3: Limb-darkening coefficients extracted for our best-precision targets (the ones spanning data in multiple sectors), compared against their theoretical predictions (blue for ATLAS models, red for PHOENIX). As can be seen, a clear offset is observed for the u2 limb-darkening coefficient with the PHOENIX models. (From Patel and Espinoza. AJ. 2021. In Prep.)</span></div>

									<p>Despite the presence of an offset shows that the model stellar atmospheres are not completely accurate, 
										comparatively, ATLAS models seems to be better at modelling the limb darkening effect than PHOENIX models (see, e.g. Figure 1). 
										Our results show that, to date, PHOENIX and ATLAS stellar model atmospheres are still not accurate descriptions of 
										the limb darkening effect at better than about 10% on average on the LDCs, at least over the TESS bandpass and when calculating 
										them properly (i.e., using the proper method for PHOENIX models as recommended in <a target="_blank" href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2015MNRAS.450.1879E/abstract">Espinoza & Jordán (2015)</a>). 
										Therefore, while modelling the effect, when fitting TESS transit light-curves, we recommend either to fit the LDCs 
										using uninformative priors or to use the results in this work as priors — and not to fix them to their theoretical 
										values calculated using the model stellar atmospheres.</p>
									
									<p>As we wanted to analyse all known exoplanets observed by TESS at that time, which turned out to be more than 170 exoplanetary systems, 
										it would be very lengthy to examine each system manually. That is why we wrote an interface between various packages to handle and 
										reduce the TESS data, and later to feed this data to another package for modelling. This whole process was made automated and 
										we would receive the final results only. The code, which is written in Python, for this interface is publicly available to use on <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/Jayshil/my_thesis">GitHub</a>.</p>
									
									<p>We have the plan to extend this study further in both observational and theoretical direction. 
										As the TESS is still working and has approved for its extended mission it will be going to observe more host stars 
										which we want to include in the analysis to make sample size large. Now another space-based observatory CHEOPS is also operational, 
										we want to include its data too in the present project. On the theoretical side, as we stated, a small part of the problem might 
										reside in the fact that ATLAS and PHOENIX are 1D model atmospheres and thus does not describe the limb darkening effect properly. 
										We plan to use 3D model atmospheres and predict the limb darkening coefficients from them and later check whether 
										they show the same bias with the empirical limb darkening coefficients or not.</p>
									
									<p>Although the central purpose of this project was to retrieve the limb darkening coefficients from exoplanet transit 
										light-curves and analyse their contrast with the theoretical ones, we also extracted various planetary parameters 
										such as the scaled semi-major axis <!DOCTYPE HTML>

                                                                            <p>This article is written with the purpose of providing guidance to the final year (or the pre-final year) Master’s students on how to prepare for their applications of doctoral studies. Although attempts have been made to make this document as general as possible so that any student working in astrophysics can benefit from it, some biases towards observational astronomy (especially observational exoplanetology) cannot be avoided since the information provided here is based on the author’s personal experience. In addition to this, this essay only deals with European (excluding the UK) PhD positions, and not with US-based graduate programs (again, a personal bias). It is advised also to look at two articles written by Prof. Katja Poppenhaeger on getting faculty jobs in the fields of astrophysics --- yes, they are on getting a faculty job, and not on getting a doctoral position. Indeed, both are very different. Yet, there are several points that could be useful while applying to PhD positions as well.</p>
                                                                            <p>There are two ways to be admitted into the PhD studies: one can either apply to a doctoral position when it is announced, or one can directly ask a potential supervisor for a possible PhD position in their research group. It is not recommended to take the later course to get a PhD position because the probability of getting a response from the supervisor is very low unless your research interests match closely. Even if a positive reply is received from the supervisor, funding for the studies would not always be available. That being said, the rest of this article is dedicated to the first way to the doctoral school, through the advertised PhD positions, for which the funding has been secured already.</p>
                                                                            <p>The very first thing to keep in mind is the time period of the application. Although the individual openings are advertised throughout the year, the doctoral programs are usually announced in September with the application deadline in November/December. Most of these programs ask for the completion of a Master’s degree before starting the position (and not at the time of application), therefore, one can apply for the position in the final year of the Master as well. It is recommended to apply while doing the Master’s research or else one may have to wait for the next year. The next crucial thing is to find the advertised PhD positions -- one cannot, of course, visit the websites of each institute and look for a vacant position. There are several dedicated job portals on which the openings of positions are advertised. Among the most popular ones are the job registers of the American Astronomical Society, and that of the European Astronomical Society. Additionally, roughly all of the Max Planck Institutes in Germany (or, at least the ones related to astrophysics/astronomy) have their dedicated doctoral school for international researchers called the International Max Planck Research School (IMPRS). Here are the links for IMPRS for several Max Planck Institutes: IMPRS in Heidelberg, IMPRS in Germany. These are great opportunities for international researchers -- the research being done in these institutes is remarkable, and many of these schools are in collaboration with other local institutes.</p>
                                                                            <p>It should be added here that there may be other websites on which such advertisements have been posted of which the author is not aware. However, it is reasonable to assume that the job register of the American Astronomical Society should be sufficient (it was sufficient for the author). The key thing is to check these portals regularly for the positions.</p>
                                                                            <p>The next step is to choose the doctoral position that is the most suitable for the applicant. It is certainly possible that, at this career stage, one has not defined any specific research area. For such a situation the doctoral schools (like IMPRS) are ideal. In these programs, no special projects are usually defined in prior; on the other hand, in many PhD positions, since a specific project is tailored beforehand, the priority is sometimes given to the candidate who has some experience in the given field. Hence, the Master’s thesis project is quite important for the PhD application --- if one applies to the position which is linked to the Master’s thesis work (or any other previous works), the chances of getting selected would be quite high. At this point, it is advised that the applicant should explore the field of research by looking at the most recent research papers so that one has an idea of what are the topics of current research in the field.</p>
                                                                            <p>Now comes the most important step of the whole process: preparing the application. The prepared application is the first and only document the selection committee would look at to judge the applicant. That is why it is really important to take the time to prepare a good application. The application material usually consists of several documents including an application form (in case of a doctoral school), a CV, a cover letter, a research statement (in some of the cases), the degree certificate (if any) and/or the transcripts of grades achieved at the time of application. Note that, although proficiency in English reading and writing is required, the proof of the same in the form of IELTS/TOEFL is usually not demanded with the rest of the application material. Finally, the applicant has to arrange two to three letters of recommendation from referees who are familiar with the work of the applicant. Make sure that the referees are informed beforehand about the application, and that they submit their letters on time. Master’s thesis advisor(s) are the best persons for sending these recommendation letters.</p>

Another article devoted to the preparation of these documents has been written by the author, which can be found here.</p>

However, in the times of corona, online interviews are becoming a thing! The interview is another thing on which one wants to spend some time. Therefore, a detailed article on it is also written -- which can be found here.</p>

										These retrieved parameters have served two aims. First, to validate our fitting and to endorse the working of TESS by comparing 
										them with their corresponding existing values from the literature (remember, we used already known exoplanets for our study). 
										The match between the empirical and the literature values of planetary parameters has been excellent - serving the first aim. 
										Second, as TESS is re-observing some of the targets for much longer time periods with its precision instruments, 
										it has the potential to update their planetary parameters. For targets of our study, we have retrieved these updated planetary 
										parameters from the transit light curves and provided their values in the paper.</p>
