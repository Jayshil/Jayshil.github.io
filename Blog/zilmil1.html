                                    <p>Lovely musical notes from a flute were flowing in the air. It was music from an old Hindi romantic song.</p>

                                    <p>It seemed that time stopped to listen to this lovely music. This music created an atmosphere very lovely. It was a beautiful evening of winter and was a time of sunset. But, the sun was not in the mood to set. They both were sitting on the river bank. That mighty river flowed from east to west. So, at sunset, the scene became very beautiful. It was like the sun wanted to take a dive in the river. Due to the reflection, downstream of the river became reddish. It was the time when migratory birds travelled from the cold part of Europe and Russia to India. So, such birds were flying in the sky to find their destination.</p>

                                    <p>In such a beautiful and romantic environment, they both were sitting behind the bike, so that no one around them can saw them.</p>

                                    <p>“You play the flute very lovely…” Girl, for whom the player was playing the flute, commented on his tune.</p>
                                    <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

                                    <!-- wp:paragraph -->
                                    <p>“No, no, no. It is not as lovely as our love. I think it’s just a poor representation of my love. I hope I could transform my whole love for you into my tunes. Then, you will be just amazed at that. Please God, give me such power…” And the boy replied to that comment.</p>
                                    <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

                                    <!-- wp:paragraph -->
                                    <p>“Damn. Today, you are more than the best. I don’t have any word to describe your art. It is your greatness that you call it just ‘poor representation.’ When you were playing the flute, you just looked like Lord Krishna. I think at that time, it was not you that played the flute, it was notorious Krishna who played it.” That girl was in a very romantic mood. And so compared her boyfriend with Lord Krishna, God of Love.</p>

                                    <p>“Wrong? He had to abandon his love for his duty. And, for sure, I don’t want to do such blunder in my life. Sanjana, I love you so much, and you know that very well. Please, be with me every time, I beg you. I can’t live without you. These are not just words, but they are my feelings for you. Also, that song, that I played, was also a reality. You really always live with me; I can feel you every time around me. Don’t ever try to make me Krishna, because I don’t want to see you as my Radha, and later abandon you, please don’t do that” That boy became very emotional on Sanjana’s comment regarding Krishna.</p>

                                    <p>“Complete six months, Sanjana. Before this, we met in summer, last May. After that, <em>barsaat bhi aakar chali gai, badal bhi garaj kar baras gaye, par unki ek zalak ko hum e husn ke malik tadap gaye…</em> (Rain came and went, clouds came, fulminated, rained and went away. But I, the ultimate lover, waited for your just one glimpse during that time – A very popular Hindi song).&nbsp; It was a really long period…”</p>

                                    <p>“Yes, it seemed to me that I travelled at very high speed during those times. So, I felt that time flowed slowly for me! Although, we talked every day, hanging out has its own magic. Video calls also can’t do that magic. Diwali also went very bad. We even not met during those holy days. Sad thing. But, we can’t do anything about this. Our career must be our first priority.”</p>

                                    <p>And then their chatter went on for hours…</p>

                                    <p>Long distance relationship. Actually, they both were from common native, Surat. But, Nikhil was Doctor in Mumbai, with his private practice, and Sanjana was in AIIMS, Delhi, in the final year of her MBBS. Nearly a thousand kilometre away from each other. Initially, for about 17 years, they studied together, first in the same school and then in the same college. But as Nikhil was slightly elder than Sanjana, his MBBS completed first. After completing MBBS, Nikhil settled in Mumbai. He had always an ambition to settle in Mumbai. Mumbai was truly a city of dreams for him.</p>
                                    <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

                                    <!-- wp:paragraph -->
                                    <p>“But how will you manage to open your own hospital in <em>Mumbai</em>?” when Nikhil told Sanjana about his plans for future in the final year of him, then that was Sanjana’s first obvious reaction. “And it is a completely unknown city for yours, how will you manage your life there?”</p>
                                    <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

                                    <!-- wp:paragraph -->
                                    <p>“Sanjana, first of all, it will not <em>my own</em> hospital, it will be <em>ours.</em> We will work together there. And don’t get panic anymore. Don’t you know my father? His name only opens all closed doors. I’d talked to him. He agreed to my clinic and home. But, I’ve to satisfy with the clinic this time, later on, I’ll build a large Hospital from that, <em>Nikhanjana Hospital and Research Centre</em>.” Nikhil told Sanjana whole plan. He was then so excited about his hospital, that he thought the name of it.</p>
                                    <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

                                    <!-- wp:paragraph -->
                                    <p>“Are you crazy?” Whether Nikhil was crazy or not, but Sanjana surely became crazy with his announcement for <em>their </em>hospital. “I think you have complete plans for <em>our </em>future. But don’t rely on your father, rather <em>step-father,</em> I don’t like that man. Many times I’d sensed something wrong, something strange in eyes of him… Politicians are not trustworthy persons. They are money-loving people, and as this also is a matter of money, they can do anything for money.”</p>
                                    <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

                                    <!-- wp:paragraph -->
                                    <p>But yes, Nikhil was a perfect man. He really had plans for their future. And followed them, he first worked in some very famous hospital in Mumbai for some time. Then finally he owned a clinic in that city of his dreams, with the help of his father. His father was a big name in Gujarat, a big politician, so had many contacts in Mumbai. With those contacts, he managed to open a small clinic and a delicious home for Nikhil in Mumbai. Nikhil was planning to own a hospital and research centre once after he earned enough money and Sanjana’s completion of her MBBS.</p>

                                    <!-- wp:paragraph -->
                                    <p>After that evening, once again their life started in two very different cities, Delhi and Mumbai.</p>
                                    <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

                                    <!-- wp:paragraph -->
                                    <p>Nikhil used to go for a long drive in Mumbai. Marine drive was his favourite place. That place liked him so much. It is just a 3.6 kilometres long road that links two plush areas, Malabar Hill and Nariman Point in South Mumbai. Its official name is Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose road, but its unofficial name, Marine drive is famous. It is long C shaped road. If you are on its Nariman Point end, then you can see its other end in direction of west. During the time of sunset, if you are in perfect position then, you can see the sun being dived in the buildings of the western end. It is a magnificent scene. On its northern end, there is popular Chowpatty Beach, famous for its <em>Bhel Puri.</em> It is a great time to go for a walk in the sunset on this road. After the sun goes below the horizon, its beauty increases. Because the street lights along the drive resemble like the pearls filled in the string of drive road, <em>queen’s neckless.</em></p>
                                    <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

                                    <!-- wp:paragraph -->
                                    <p>Nikhil used to spend many of his evenings by sitting on the roadside of Marine Drive and see the beautiful sunset. This place liked him very much from when he saw that in some random Bollywood movie. He always dreamt to settle nearby that beautiful place. Yes, he has a habit of daydreaming, though has the capability to achieve that.</p>

                                    <p>“…there will be our flat nearby this place. Every morning and evening we will jog to this beauty. Every evening we will say goodbye to the setting sun, and every morning, we will welcome the rising sun, together. Some days, we will enjoy the Bhel Puri of Chowpatty, your favourite dish. From the balcony of our flat, we will observe the infiniteness of the huge sea in front of us, and those stormy waves which wash those beautiful stones of that protection wall…” once when Sanjana visited Mumbai to his hospital, he shared his dreams with her.</p>

And that garden will be more beautiful than a rose garden.) These were not just words for him, these were had very deep meaning than that.</p>
