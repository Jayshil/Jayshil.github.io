                                    <p>The announcement of Legislative Assembly Election in Gujarat was just done by ECI. Many candidates jumped in this election to try out their luck. In those 2 months, the state witnessed every kind of political drama by all the parties and their candidates. Many malcontent candidates changed their loyalty and shifted to the new political party as per new demanding situations. But when results announced, most of them drew a blank, failed to understand the mind of common people. Gujarat had never accepted those turncoat candidates.</p>

                                    <p>One of them was Nikhil’s father. Before the election, his party gave the candidacy to his rival candidate by ignoring him. So, his father decided to change the party before the election, as the opposite party was agreed to give him candidacy of them. But unfortunately, his all calculations became wrong. He badly lost that election to his rival candidate, who was from his mother party. Even he lost his deposit and all the money that he spent during the election campaign was wasted. He was about to become bankrupt. He was very short tempered, and so decided to teach him a very good lesson.</p>

                                    <p>Exactly in these times, Sanjana completed her MBBS. So, it’s time for celebration. Sanjana directly flew to Mumbai and met Nikhil. From many days her father asked her about her marriage. Both of theirs’s families were unknown about their relationship. Now, Sanjana thought that it is time to reveal her relationship with her parents. But before that, she met Nikhil and both of them decided to throw a party in celebration of the completion of her graduation. They had the plan to reveal their relationship in front of the whole crowd including parents of both.</p>

                                    <p>“Yes, of course. How can I forget that late night rambling on campus? And I became extremely happy when I thought that from some days later onward, we can live our long life together.” Both were very happy because they thought that very soon, they are going to marry. But no one knows what is there written in the destiny of them!</p>

                                    <p>It was the day of Makar-Sankranti – kite flying festival. Almost all the people were on the terrace. Some of them were flying kite, some of them were holding <em>firkis</em> of their companion who was flying kites. Loud music was playing there on the terrace. Some people were just enjoying that music and watching the sky full of the kites. The wind was blowing at normal speed – good for flying kite. Sun was on its way to the horizon, quite near was already reached. The west direction became red with its redness. Darkness was rising in the atmosphere as the sun approached towards the horizon. But most of the people were still flying the kites regardless of the darkness. Two such persons were Nikhil and Sanjana. They both were on the terrace of their common friend. Both were flying kites side by side. Almost all people nearby took down their kites, but they were not in the mood to take down kites. Both were in the mood of cut down each other’s kite. Since a long time they were trying to do so, but as both are good kite-fighters, both were failing.</p>

                                    <p>“What’s the…” And his question remained incomplete, as he saw that Sanjana was giving him flying kiss. He was about to give an answer to her kiss, but suddenly…,</p>
                                    <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

                                    <!-- wp:paragraph -->

                                    <p>Suddenly he realized something. Quickly he went nearby her, hold her firki and told,</p>

                                    <p>“Sanjana, my kite went on its some infinite random journey.” He continued the conversation by looking straight into her beautiful eyes, “I also want to go on some journey. Would you like to come on travel with me?”</p>

Listen, its destination will be the contentment of our lives.”</p>

                                    <p>Wow! She was just amazed by the way that he proposed herself. She was not in the situation of breaking eye contact with him. She was blushing from inside. She had not imagined that he would propose her in <em>this</em> way. She had expected something different. Although there was a special type of feelings between them and both were aware of that, no one wanted to reveal that, because they feared that in doing so they would have lost another. Whenever they decided to meet, Sanjana always not to forget to make Nikhil’s favourite dish. Nikhil was master at organic chemistry, but Sanjana wasn’t. So Nikhil had taken the responsibility of her study of organic chemistry. Both were aware of their <em>special</em> feeling towards each other, but none of them wants to take initiative. But that day Nikhil took it. It was the time when for the first time Nikhil was so long away to his home and so Sanjana. Then only he realized the value of Sanjana in his life and decided to tell her about his feelings when first they meet.</p>

                                    <p>“But promise me that you will never make me alone on this trip…” After breaking a quite long awkward silence, Sanjana indirectly accepted to travel with him.</p>
                                    <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

                                    <!-- wp:paragraph -->
                                    <p>Next after, it was another period of silence. Both were very emotional. Then Nikhil slowly came closer to her, threw the firki of her which he held in his hands, covered both sides of her face with his hands and then kissed her gently on her forehead. Sanjana in return hugged him tightly. Still, their eye contact was not broken. But their lips were not seemed to be satisfied with what they had done. Sanjana then put her hands on his shoulders and moved closer and his lips painted with the colour of lipsticks of her.</p>

                                    <p>The sun and the moon were only witnesses of their union. The sun was already blushed with their union, and so its face became reddish and tried itself to hide behind some buildings. The moon was giving its blessings to this newly made couple from the zenith. Some <em>tukkals</em> were flying in the sky to give them blessings.</p>

                                    <p>That evening was glorious. The party management company had been completed its task very beautifully. As it was the party of becoming Sanjana a doctor, the theme for the party was also according to it. The stage was built like the ward of a hospital; the mic was of the shape of the stethoscope; instead of chairs, there were beds to sit; all of the guests had to wear aprons on their casuals. The hall was full of peoples. When Nikhil saw that parents of both of them had arrived, he thought that it would be better to do announcement first.</p>

They were asking me whether I’ve a girlfriend or not, but I denied to tell them anything. I think, now, this is the time. So mom and dad, yes, I’m in a relationship. Please Sanjana, come forward… with this beautiful girl, my best friend, my fellow doctor and ex-classmate, Sanjana…”</p>

Yes, the rival candidate, from whom Nikhil’s father lost the election, on whom Nikhil’s father was very angry, was actually Sanjana’s father. Oh!

She tried to stop him, but that day, he was not in the mood to stop.</p>
