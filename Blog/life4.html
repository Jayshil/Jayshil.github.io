                                        "... that the aim of the universe is to produce the intelligent life? And doesn't the aim of the intelligent life is to use the universe to make its own origination meaningful, by observing it (the universe), by sustaining themselves (the life), by spreading themselves, by making universe full with life?! Perhaps the universe and the life are complementary to each other. The existence of one without the another is meaningless..."
                                    </blockquote>
									<p>This was the closing statement of my previous article in this series, Life: What is the purpose of life as a whole? And I argued that it could be to fill the local universe with life.</p>
																		
									<p>Why just 'local' universe? Why not the 'whole' universe? Because it might be possible that there might be other life-forms be evolved in the other parts of the universe. But, until now we haven't heard of them. Then where are they? This is the statement of famous Fermi's Paradox. There are two possible ways to explain this paradox. It might be possible that every life-forms are very very different from each other so that they can't identify each other. For example, life on the earth is carbon-based. But it entirely possible that other life-forms are based on some other elements, like maybe silicon. In that case, it is possible that we might not recognize that life form at all.</p>

									<!-- wp:paragraph -->
                                    <p>Another possibility is that two life forms are well separated from each other so that they could never contact each other. Why? Remember the history of human civilization. Except for the polytheist civilizations, no two civilizations were able to tolerate each other. Eventually, they tried to destroy one another. Remember what happened to Mayans, Inkas, Red Indians, etc. So, who guarantees that the same thing one life form don't do with another? It is therefore desirable to distribute life forms such that they never get in touch with one another. Another purpose of such distribution might be to prevent life forms from biological pollution by other life forms.</p>
                                    <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

                                    <!-- wp:paragraph -->
                                    <p>So we can safely conclude that there might be only one civilization, or life form, per galaxy. In such a case, we have to lose the hope to meet another civilization from another galaxy. Because two galaxies are normally separated from one another by millions of light years. And it may be impossible to travel such a huge distance in one lifetime. Travel through the wormhole is one possible way to do that, but wormholes are just a theoretical phenomenon. Mathematically many things may exist but that does not mean that every such thing could exists in reality.&nbsp;So travel by wormhole may not be possible even in a distant future.</p>

                                    <!-- wp:paragraph -->
                                    <p>This narrow down the aim of life to populate the&nbsp;<strong><em>local</em></strong> universe.</p>
                                    <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

                                    <!-- wp:paragraph -->
                                    <p>This is <em>not an easy task</em>. Because to fill the local universe with life is a very&nbsp;<em><strong>long-term</strong></em><em>&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em><strong>slow</strong></em> process. One particular life-being can't determine the race of life. One has to contribute what could possible to her/him in her/his lifetime. One&nbsp;<em>has</em> to contribute because the goal to be achieved is very high and to achieve it we need a&nbsp;<em><strong>high technology.</strong></em> It takes a huge amount of time to achieve such technological achievements.</p>
                                    <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

                                    <!-- wp:paragraph -->
                                    <p>The large-scale goal is to populate the local universe with&nbsp;<strong>similar</strong> life forms. Here one important thing to note is that I am using the word life-<em>forms</em>. This includes whole life on the single planet. Everything ranging from trees to animals to humans, a <em><strong>whole ecological system</strong></em>. The main reason for this is that&nbsp;<em><strong>humans, or any intelligent life, can't survive only by themselves. They need a whole ecological system to survive for a long period.</strong></em> This is really a&nbsp;<em>very very difficult task.</em> To do that, first, the intelligent being has to leave his/her home planet. Then eventually s/he can take other intelligent beings with him/her and finally can&nbsp;<em><strong>terraform</strong></em> the new place. But initially one must leave the planet. There are two big challenges those can prevent this: the&nbsp;<strong>technological</strong> challenges and&nbsp;<strong>psychological</strong> challenges.</p>
                                    <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

                                    <!-- wp:paragraph -->
                                    <p>Between these two challenges, the&nbsp;<strong>technological</strong> challenges are more important and more crucial. To leave the planet, one needs to achieve some threshold velocity called the&nbsp;<strong>escape velocity</strong>. For earth, the value of escape velocity is about <em>11.2 km/s.</em> This is a very large velocity, mind it! And it is very difficult to achieve this velocity. As the mass to be sent to space is high, the thrust it would need will also be very high. This is a very difficult and costly task. One needs to find better fuel, or a better way, to get into space easily and cheaply. For that, one not only needs the&nbsp;<em>technological advancements</em> but also the progress in roughly all fields.</p>
                                    <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

                                    <!-- wp:paragraph -->
                                    <p>The psychological effect of such a journey would also be notable. You leave your home, your fellow humans for a&nbsp;<em>long</em> journey. You need to prepare your mind well. Hibernation of life is not reliable. Just an insignificant error can result in loss of life (Remember the accident from the movie, 2001: A Space Odyssey). We actually don't know how our mind might going to react in such a long and lonely journey.</p>
                                    <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

                                    <!-- wp:paragraph -->
                                    <p>To achieve the larger goal of fill the local universe with the similar life form, one first need to overcome above difficulties. And this must be the task for every single being. I am not saying that leave whatever you are doing and think only how to build a better spacecraft! NO! This is <em>not</em> the thing. You only need to advance your field only.&nbsp; Because in the planning of such a travel, knowledge of roughly all field will be needed. Take an example. Suppose you are a novel-writer. So your goal should (<em>must!?</em>) be to produce better and better literature. Through this literature can origin revolutionary ideas like those from the literatures of Jules Verne and HG Wells. This beautiful literature can also entertain those who are building a spaceship and those who are going to travel in it! Similar logic applies to every field.</p>
                                    <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

                                    <!-- wp:paragraph -->
                                    <p>So, I think in the end, only&nbsp;<em>Karmas</em> matters, though I previously questioned the significance of it!&nbsp;<em><strong>Karmas those can advance human knowledge.</strong></em> So to achieve the bigger goal of colonizing the local universe, every life-being should do their Karmas. They have to. Because this is the goal that is on us.</p>
                                    <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

                                    <!-- wp:paragraph -->
                                    <p>Isn't this is just the <em><strong>Karmayoga</strong></em> described in&nbsp;<em><strong> Shrimad Bhagavadgita</strong></em>? One has to do their Karmas, otherwise, the technological advancement could not happen. This will lead towards not achieving the goal of life form.&nbsp;If we do not achieve this goal, then we are eventually going to die when the sun, or the parent star, will die. And if that happens then the universe will end up with the no life in it, and then what could be the purpose of such empty (in the sense of observer) universe?!</p>

                                    <p>So,&nbsp;<em><strong>do your Karmas.&nbsp;</strong></em>That could be the only purpose of this mortal life.</p>
