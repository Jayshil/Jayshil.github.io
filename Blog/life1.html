                                    <p>Once Carl Sagan mentioned in his very famous book&nbsp;<em><strong>'A Pale Blue Dot'</strong></em>&nbsp;that our earth is just another small terrain world in vast space. Nothing similar to it exists in the nearby universe. It is one of the small planets in our solar system, which is orbiting a very common star. There are roughly 10<sup>11</sup> stars in our galaxy, and the same number of the galaxies is present in our observable universe. So there might be 10<sup>22</sup> stars around which planets are orbiting them in the observable universe.</p>

                                    <!-- wp:paragraph -->
                                    <p>And yet life is found only on the earth!!</p>
                                    <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

                                    <!-- wp:paragraph -->
                                    <p>Okay, there may be technological limitations to us now in finding life on another planet, but aren't there any other extra-terrestrial intelligent civilization exists that is able to find us? Among those 10<sup>22</sup> planets, at least one another planet must become the harbour for the intelligent life, which can find us if we are not able to find them. To conclude that we are alone in this vast universe seems a bit illogical (and terrifying as well!). As Metradorus said a long ago, the existence of life only on the earth is like you plant seeds in the whole farm but only one of them would grow.&nbsp;If it is just us, as Carl Sagan once said, <em><strong>seems like an awful waste of space</strong></em>. And by observation also, we have found so many exoplanets orbiting around many stars. Many of them might be potential to produce a life on it! This argument leads us to the conclusion that our universe must be filled with life.</p>
                                    <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

                                    <!-- wp:paragraph -->
                                    <p>But, then,&nbsp;<em><strong>where are they?</strong></em></p>
                                    <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

                                    <!-- wp:paragraph -->
                                    <p>This is the very famous <strong>Fermi Paradox</strong>. If we accept the premise that the universe must be full with life, then its conclusion would be that until now we should have to meet with them. But this didn't happen. We met no extra-terrestrial life. This is the paradox, as premise and conclusion contradict each other, which is named after its inventor <strong>Enrico Fermi.</strong></p>
                                    <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

                                    <!-- wp:paragraph -->
                                    <p>There is no simple statement that can explain this paradox. So we&nbsp;<em>have</em> to solve the paradox by accepting that we are really&nbsp;<em>alone</em> in this vast universe and&nbsp;<strong><em>intelligent life on the earth is just unique and lucky coincidence.</em></strong></p>
                                    <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

                                    <!-- wp:paragraph -->
                                    <p>There are several reasons (maybe conditions) for such a&nbsp;<em>coincidence.</em></p>
                                    <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

                                    <!-- wp:paragraph -->
                                    <p>The parent star, around which the planet is orbiting should be in so-called&nbsp;<em><strong>Galactic Habitable Zone</strong>.&nbsp;</em>This is the zone in which star density is not so low, not so high. Near the centre of the galaxy, the density of stars is very high that two stars may be very near to each other. In that case, one star would shower the dangerous gamma rays to the potentially habitable planet. In such a continuous shower of gamma rays, life could not evolve. And also near the centre of the galaxy, as the density of the star is very high, the probability of the violent death of any star is high. This violent death means another shower of gamma rays! Life will not originate in such a harsh environment.</p>
                                    <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

                                    <!-- wp:paragraph -->
                                    <p>But what if the parent star is far away from the centre of the galaxy? In the outskirts of any galaxy, the population of stars is very low. That means these regions are metal-poor regions. (In Astronomy, any elements heavier than hydrogen and helium are called&nbsp;<em>metals.</em>) To originate life metals are essential. So, life will not originate if parent star is in the outskirt of the galaxy.</p>
                                    <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

                                    <!-- wp:paragraph -->
                                    <p>Same goes with the position of the planet around its parent star. The planet must be in the <em><strong>habitable zone</strong></em> of its parent star. This&nbsp;<em>habitable zone</em> is the zone around each star in which water can remain in liquid form. Liquid&nbsp; Water is essential for an Earth-like life form. If a potential planet is very far from its parent star than the temperature would so low, and if the planet is very near to its parent star than the temperature would very high for life.</p>
                                    <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

                                    <!-- wp:paragraph -->
                                    <p>Other conditions include the existence of a giant planet at a proper distance to the planet, a medium size moon to stabilize the orbit of the planet etc. The existence of giant planet would prevent the planet from the occasional collision of the planet with meteorites, comets etc.&nbsp; These all are the external conditions. But there are many other internal conditions also.</p>
                                    <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

                                    <!-- wp:paragraph -->
                                    <p>These internal conditions include the size and structure of the planet, the atmosphere of the planet etc. Size of the planet is also important to the habitability of the planet. If the size of the planet is very big then its giant gravitational tug would not help in creating life. Also, if its size is small then the core activity of the planet may stop very early. This would lead to the early loss of the magnetic field around that planet. Without a magnetic field, life can't survive for long and if magnetic field lost before even life could form then energetic particles from outer space couldn't start the formation of the primary molecules for the life.</p>
                                    <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

                                    <!-- wp:paragraph -->
                                    <p>Both of these conditions, external and internal conditions, are important to the habitability of any planet. If any of the above conditions not fulfilled then life on the earth would not be possible. And if one calculates the probability of the existence of the habitable planet, it will be very small, according to the law of the multiplication of the probability. So it is a very lucky coincidence.</p>
                                    <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

                                    <!-- wp:paragraph -->
                                    <p>Origin of life on the earth is just only one part of the coincidence. There is another story behind the survival of life. But survival is not enough.&nbsp;<em><strong>Evolution of life</strong></em> is another thing. Evolution until the formation of intelligent life is another big coincidence.</p>
