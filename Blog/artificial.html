									<p>What if I tell you that in the next 50 years or so most of our jobs will going to take over by computers! 
										Would you believe it? Probably not, right? But, I do! I do believe that in the upcoming years you will see 
										that most of the tasks will be carried out by not humans, but machines. 
										And this is not the distant future -- this might become reality in less than even 50 years!
									</p>
																		
									<p>Here, by the way, by computers, I don't mean just the personal computers with monitor, 
										CPU and all other things or maybe laptops or tablets or human-like robots --- 
										I meant any pre-programmed device can be classified as the computers. In this context, 
										I have used the words 'computers', 'machines' and 'artificial intelligence' interchangeably throughout this article.
									</p>
									
									<p>Returning to our main question - why would artificial intelligence take over all our jobs? 
										Why on the earth we would let this happen? Furthermore, in the title of this article, 
										I describe this as the supposedly inevitable phenomenon. The answer to this question - 
										and the possibility of this even happening - lies in just the one word: Capitalism. 
										We are living in the capitalist world in which everything is governed by its value - capital - profit. 
										And when it comes to any product, it will gain its maximum value and the profit only when it is complete, 
										without any errors or mistakes. That's a quite challenging task for any human being, 
										especially when the task is repetitive. Every single day would not be going to be the same - 
										someday we feel good, or someday we feel bad. This reflects on the quality of the work we have done. 
										We will make mistakes and that will reduce the value (which results in a decrement of a margin of profit) of any final product. 
										Capitalist system won't like this. On the other hand, machines are excellent at their said tasks, especially repetitive ones. 
										Only once you need to programme them and rest will do the machine - produce the final product with the minimum, if not none, mistakes. 
										They will do your task round the clock without asking for any break or making any 'machine unions'. 
										Additionally, you don't have to look after all machines once after you programmed them to some task - they will automatically do all those things. 
										(This is, in fact, another advantage of using machines: to automize the whole process) This all will, in turn, increase the profits. 
										That is why, economically, the capitalist system will make sure that every such task will be done by machines in all fields, not by humans. 
										Capitalists know very well that some small investment in this field will profit them in the long term so 
										they will never hesitate to spend their money in research of automatization of all things by artificial intelligence.</p>
									
									<p>Another way to understand this as an inevitable phenomenon is human comfort. 
										Just think again, how machines made our daily life more comfortable than ever! 
										Nowadays you don't have to wash your cloaths by yourselves, you don't have to do dishes by yourselves; 
										you have machines to do all those stuff. You can do many things on your smartphone. 
										I can give you my personal example in this situation. In this March - April, I was in Germany for my project research work. 
										I was working on so-called exoplanets. In this work, I would download the data for one exoplanet, extract the information 
										from the data and then analyse the data (this would take nearly four to five hours). Believe me, this was a boring task; 
										that too for just one exoplanet. After completing the whole thing for one exoplanet, I had 48 other waiting in which I had to do the same. 
										By just the thought of this, I got tired. So what I did was to make a computer program which can do all these things for me automatically - 
										and directly give me results. I literally wrote a code which can replace me. To analyse all these 49 exoplanets it took nearly a week - 
										even when it was working round the clock. If I would have tried to do the same it would have taken more than a week to 
										complete the whole thing for I would not have worked 24 hours. That 2000 lines of code save my time and energy so that 
										I was able to focus more on the results - which were, in fact, more important than the analysis of the data. 
										I think this is the main goal of such codes so that we can focus more on results rather than wasting our energy and time on some redundant tasks! 
										This is, also I think, how the artificial intelligence introduced in the first place - to do the redundant tasks. 
										But eventually, it became (and becoming and will become) much more intelligent so that it can do a wide range of other tasks as well.</p>
									
									<p>In most of our works we always need to make some important decisions to do our job well. 
										These decisions, sometimes, proved to be very crucial in determining the fate of even country. 
										In such times any human can make less efficient judgements by flowing into the course of emotions while purely 
										rational determinations only are the most effective ones in such cases. Also, we can't analyse all past experiences 
										at once and can't give our 100 per cent on the new data available which can be useful in the decision making. 
										In these cases, machines (i.e. programs), based on previous information and available new data, can make their best decision on their own. 
										And often, as these judgements are free from any emotions and based on mathematics, 
										they proved to be a better prediction of future courses of events. This is also one another advantage of using computer programs.</p>
									
									<p>Another matter is of precision: there are some tasks which needs extreme precision to achieve something. 
										For example, flying an aircraft, or launching a satellite. We simply can not do these any of tasks without the help of computers. 
										In that way, we are totally dependent on computers. There are some other areas also in which we can use the precision of machines, 
										like in very delicate brain or heart surgery.</p>
									
									<p>Imagine just one day without your smartphone then I don't need to explain you further. 
										We got so used to with all these machines that we can't even imagine a single day without them. 
										No one wants to leave all these luxuries and live in back in those old days of the early twentieth century!</p>
									
									<p>So our economy is a quite enthusiast about the entry of artificial intelligence in our daily lives. 
										But can modern-day technology keep pace with the needs of our economy? 
										Is it even scientifically possible to make a satisfactory program which can replace us? Let's see!</p>
									
									<p>Before understanding about artificial intelligence, we must interpret our natural intelligence. 
										I would like to call it 'intellect' rather than 'intelligence'. The reason is simple, our intellect - or brainpower, 
										or whatever we have - is more than just that; we also have consciousness about all those things, which lacks in our artificial counterpart. 
										We are conscious of our intelligence and that makes the difference between us and machines. 
										And I don't think, neither do most of the scientists, that machines ever going to achieve consciousness. 
										But the problem is that most of our jobs do not need consciousness to do them; they can easily be achieved only using 
										intelligence which machines do have, and probably more of it than what we have. Yes, computer codes might have superseded us in intelligence! 
										We all have experience of loss in a smartphone chess game. We are not alone, a former world chess champion Garry Kasparov 
										also faced a defeat from IBM's Deep Blue computer! A good, rather alarming example could be of Watson - an another IBM designed computer. 
										This artificial intelligence has defeated its two human companions (who were former winners of the show) in a classic television quiz show, 
										Jeopardy. These may be enough examples to show that artificial intelligence is giving us a hard time already.</p>
									
									<p>becoming difficult to beat artificial intelligence we need to know how they work. 
										Their intelligence is the result of complex computer algorithms. 
										An algorithm is nothing but a series of steps to follow to achieve some task. 
										A simple algorithm to make a tea would more or less look like,</p>
									
									<ul>
										<li>Take a cup full of water from which you want to make tea.</li>
										<li>Boil this water. (One might want a specific temperature and length of time of boiling here)</li>
										<li>Find a teabag of the desired flavour.</li>
										<li>Pour this teabag into the boiled water for 5 minutes.</li>
										<li>Stir it well and your tea is ready!</li>
									</ul>

									<p>Now the thing is that even if you don't know how to make a tea then also you can just follow these steps and can make a decent tea. Anyone can make tea if s/he follows this procedure (or algorithm). Here's the important step: what if we teach this algorithm to a machine? Then it would also be capable to make a tea. Here one point I would like to make very clear that do not assume that this machine would look more or less like a human with all proper limbs and move around the room to make tea with its hand. No, this machine, most probably, will not resemble anything like a human. You might probably push some buttons on a cupboard to tell it how much water you want and which flavour of tea you want. The idea is that that machine will still follow the above algorithm to make a tea.</p>

									<p>It turned out that most of our works can be segmented into above such algorithms however complex they might be. You may not have realized yet that whatever work you do is most of the time based on some written or non-written rules or steps, except for some very rare research-based or some creative jobs. Your job is to simply follow those steps, meaning an algorithm. Now if we somehow teach this algorithm to a machine then it can also follow these steps and do that work - without making any fuss or without being erroneous. This will profit more to its employer.</p>

									<p>This all is possible only when you have an algorithm for any task, but what if you haven't. What if even you don't know how to make tea? Then you would probably want to observe how other people are making tea. From repetitive observations on a large number of people, you will be able to observe some kind of emerging pattern among them - and from this, you can guess the basic idea of tea-making. Now it is entirely possible that you can teach machine (i.e. write an algorithm for a machine) to learn things on its own - what is called a machine learning. This entire field is somewhat premature nowadays, but if this turned out to be a huge success then it would truly be a great leap towards the automation of things. Then the machine will learn the algorithm of more complicated tasks by it's own using machine learning algorithms. Result of this revolution would be that no job would remain untouched by computers then.</p>

									<p>In conclusion, our capitalist economy is more than happy to welcome the new era of artificial intelligence. And no one can stop that now. Even if someone tries to stop this revolution s/he will fail economically as her/his competitors will deliver better products than her/him by using machines. So in the long run, s/he will be in loss. On the other hand, science is continuously advancing on the path of this new revolution to achieve this goal set by the economy.</p>

									<p>The big problem with this revolution would be that it will make hundreds of thousand people unemployed -- which is inevitable for we can't stop this new revolution. All we can do is to find new areas of jobs in which human can work. For this, we need to explore the fields which encompass, which uses our consciousness, or human emotions. Because computers already beat us in the case of intelligence, but I think they can never defeat us in consciousness. Our consciousness or emotions make us unique, make us different from machines --- and we need to use that against the unemployment caused by AI. We need to be prepared, otherwise, unemployment is going to become a big issue in future.</p>

									<p>Yes, we need to be ready for this new revolution!</p>
