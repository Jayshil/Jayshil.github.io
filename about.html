									<p>So if you’re fond of watching good tv shows then you might have guessed correctly that 
										I am a fan of famous BBC TV series <a target="_blank" href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1475582/">Sherlock</a>! 
										However, I liked the novels from Sir Arthur Conan Doyle 
										more than the modernized version of it in the form of the TV show, anyhow, he is my favourite.</p>
									<p>The reason might be that I myself use 'the Science of deduction' in my daily life, like Mr Holmes, 
										as an astronomer. The main difference between us, though, is that he examines earthly objects 
										to deduce things while I observe heavenly bodies and infer my results (and, furthermore, I don’t 
										have anyone as my Doctor Watson). Although my body is on the Earth (and I don’t have any future 
										plans to leave it, especially after watching <a target="_blank" href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1454468/">
										Gravity</a>) my soul has always wandered the huge vastness 
										of the universe. As a child, I would go on for morning walk outside of my town just to see the Orion 
										in the morning sky with my father, who, by the way, is an amateur astronomer. I always liked this 
										magnificent constellation in the night sky. This my same love of star-gazing was going to lead me on my 
										current career path as a professional astronomer.</p>
									<p>This long journey started when I attended a summer school on astronomy and astrophysics at 
										the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.iucaa.in/index.html">Inter-University Center for 
										Astronomy and Astrophysics</a> (IUCAA) in Pune, India. Later on, 
										I studied about exoplanets at the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.iiap.res.in/">Indian Institute 
										of Astrophysics</a> in Bengaluru, India --- which inspired 
										me to work more in this area of exoplanetary science, in which I am working on currently</p>
									<p>While studying exoplanets I started to think about life – how life formed, why life formed etc. 
										This thinking led me to the study of philosophy which now become another area of my interest along 
										with psychology, neuroscience, genetics and computer science. Yeah, although my research lies in the field of exoplanets,
										my interests lie in a broad spectrum ranging from physics to biology and computer science!</p>
									<p>As you might have guessed from the starting that I love watching good shows. My other hobby is to read 
										- I read a lot. Not just fiction, or just English literature. I like to read every genre in fiction
										 and non-fiction through English as well as Gujarati literature. I wouldn’t consider myself a good 
										 writer but still, I love to write. On this website, you can find some of my articles in English as 
										 well as Gujarati.</p>
									<p>On this amazing adventure of my life, I have completed my Master's degree in Physics from 
										<a target="_blank" href="https://www.svnit.ac.in/">Sardar Vallabhbhai National Institute of 
										Technology</a> (SVNIT), Surat, Gujarat, India. During the times of COVID-19, I moved to beautiful Geneva in Switzerland 
										to take classes at the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.unige.ch/sciences/astro/en/">
										Geneva Observatory</a> in the field of astrophysics, especially in the exoplanetary science. 
										Starting from October 2021, I joined Department of Astronomy at Stockholm University as a PhD student in the 
										group of Prof. Alexis Brandeker, where I continue to work on characterizing exoplanets.
										Even before my undergraduation, I was studying for my High School Certification (HSC) from 
										Sir C J New High School in my home town, Gandevi --- which is located in a quite greenish area of Navsari 
										district of Gujarat state in India.</p>
									<p>So this is about me! Hope that you’ll enjoy my writing!</p>
									<p>Cheers!</p>
